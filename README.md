## Hi there 👋

I am a 15 year old CS student, currently thinking of pursuing a career in Systems Programming. \
I'm currently working on [async.h](https://github.com/anny-moose/async.h), a library implementing a task system with a thread pool and promises in C. (loosely inspired by C#'s Task<T>)\
\
Currently, my primary languages are C and C++.\
I also know the basics of Rust.
